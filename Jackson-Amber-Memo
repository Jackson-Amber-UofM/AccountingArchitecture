\maketitle
You don't have to look hard to find examples in which an industry has failed to account for a changing landscape.
The music industry offers a prime example of this scenario as it failed to account for on-line distribution models
and, as a result, hemorrhaged enormous profits to entrepreneurs who understood where the industry was heading.
It's not hard to imagine the Accounting profession suffering the same fate as a glutted IT market seeks to diversify. 

In anticipation of this trend, the Accounting profession needs to get in on the ground floor- that is, at the 
institutional level.  Incorporating IT into the fabric of the curriculum will help usher in the new role 
accountants must adopt if they are to adjust to the technological requirements they must adopt to stay current.  
By offering undergraduate and post-graduate degrees with an additional emphasis on technology, future 
accountants will come to see technological proficiency as  an intrinsic, rather than supplementary, part of 
their professional role.
