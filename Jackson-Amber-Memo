\maketitle
You don't have to look hard to find examples in which an industry has failed to account for a changing landscape.  The music industry offers a prime example of this scenario as it failed to account for on-line distribution models and, as a result, hemorrhaged enormous profits to entrepreneurs who understood where the industry was heading.  It's not hard to imagine the Accounting profession suffering the same fate as a glutted IT market seeks to diversify. 

In anticipation of this trend, the Accounting profession needs to get in on the ground floor- that is, at the institutional level.  Incorporating IT into the fabric of an advanced curriculum will help usher in the new role accountants must adopt if they are to adjust to the technological requirements they must adopt to stay current.  By offering undergraduate and post-graduate degrees with an additional emphasis on technology, future accountants will come to see technological proficiency as  an intrinsic, rather than supplementary, part of their professional role.  

It's not really that hard to imagine a Computer Science degree with an emphasis on Accounting.  The converse should also be true.
